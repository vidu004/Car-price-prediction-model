# Car-price-prediction-model
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict the selling price of cars based on various features such as age, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and more. The Random Forest Regressor was selected as the final model after comparing its performance with other algorithms like Linear Regression, Lasso, and Decision Tree Regressor. The model is deployed as a web application using Flask, allowing users to input car details and get price predictions instantly.
